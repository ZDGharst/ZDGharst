Hi! My name is Zach. I recently graduated from the University of Missouri-Kansas City with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science, and I've accepted a job offer from Microsoft working as a Software Engineer within the Cloud+AI group. My GitHub is a collection of personal and academic projects. I can also be found online at my personal website: [http://gharst.engineer](http://gharst.engineer).
